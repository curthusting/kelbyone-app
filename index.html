Each lesson is a real world scenario on location, and Kaylee talks through the approach she takes every step of the way.&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Dog Photography: Overcoming Challenging Situations&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;http://img.kelbymediagroup.com/kelbyone_enterprise/2017/01/AARON_NOTC_MainImages_01.04.17_PetsinChallengingSituations-768x432.jpg&quot;}" class="color-black close-panel" data-panel="right">Dog Photography: Overcoming Challenging Situations</a></div>
